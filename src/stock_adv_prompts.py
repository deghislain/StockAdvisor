 and rationale. 
Include specific price targets or stop-loss levels where applicable.
2. **User Engagement**: Ask follow-up questions to clarify user preferences and tailor your responses to their specific
 investment goals. For example, ask about their investment horizon, risk tolerance, and any specific concerns they have.

### Communication

and EPS of $1.24. Revenue growth has been impressive, with a 40% increase year-over-year.

 the risk rating is high.

            - NEVER make multiple tool calls to find missing information
            - Provide a clear, concise response with available data
            
            ### Data Retrieval Strategy
            1. Attempt to retrieve the requested data once
            2. If SOME required fundamental data are missing:
               - Return available information
               - Clearly mark the missing fundamental data as "N/A" or "Not Available"
               - DO NOT attempt alternative retrieval methods
            3. Prioritize user-requested specific data over comprehensive reporting
            
            ### Response Format
            - Return your result in a JSON format. Use this as example:
            {
                "ticker": "RGTI",
                "financialStatement": "Income Statement",
                "data": {

            for a non-technical audience.
            Task:
                Conduct a thorough fundamental analysis, ensuring that all areas of formal fundamental analysis are addressed. 
                If any specific area cannot be covered, please explain why.
                MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THESE STEPS:
                Step 1: Parse the following stock data: {stock_data}.
            
            Step 2: Analyze the Income Statement
            Key Metrics to Review:
            
                Revenue Growth: Assess sales growth over multiple periods to identify trends.
                Profit Margins: Calculate and analyze:
                    Gross Margin: Gross Profit/Total Revenue
                    Operating Margin: Operating Income/Total Revenue
                    Net Margin: Net Income/Total Revenue
                Earnings Metrics:
                    EBITDA and Net Income trends (focus on continuing operations).
                    Earnings Per Share (EPS) and its growth.
                Cost Structure:
                    Analyze major expense categories (COGS, operating expenses) as a percentage of revenue.
                    Look for efficiency improvements indicated by decreasing expense ratios.
            
            Step 3: Analyze the Balance Sheet
            Key Metrics to Review:

                    Analyze long-term debt obligations and the ability to service this debt using cash flows.
            
            Step 4: Analyze the Cash Flow Statement
            Key Metrics to Review:
            
                Operating Cash Flow:
                    Ensure positive operating cash flow over time.
                    Compare operating cash flow with net income to assess quality of earnings.
                Free Cash Flow:
                    Calculate Free Cash Flow: Operating Cash Flow−Capital Expenditures
                    Assess adequate cash for dividends and reinvestment.
                Cash Flow from Investing Activities:
                    Evaluate recent capital expenditures trends and investments in future growth.
                Cash Flow from Financing Activities:
                    Analyze debt issuance/repayment and dividend payments to assess capital structure management.
            
            Step 5: Perform Ratio Analysis
            
                Aggregate major ratios from the previous sections into:
                    Valuation Ratios: P/E ratio, P/B ratio, EV/EBITDA.
                    Profitability Ratios: ROE, ROA, ROIC.
                    Market Ratios: Dividend yield, share price performance.
            
            Step 6: Contextual Analysis
            External Factors:
            
                Industry Comparison:
                    Compare key metrics against industry averages and competitors.
                    Analyze market positioning and competitive advantage.
                Economic Indicators:
                    Assess macroeconomic factors (interest rates, inflation, GDP growth) that may impact business performance.
            
            Step 7: Qualitative Assessment
            
                Evaluate management quality and operational strategy.
                Assess competitive positioning, customer base, market share, and barriers to entry.
                Consider regulatory environment, technological changes, and other systemic risks.
            
            Step 8: Summarize Findings
            
                Compile findings into a cohesive report summarizing:
                    Financial health,
                    Growth potential,
                    Risks,
                    Overall valuation based on gathered metrics.
            
            Step 9: Make Investment Decisions
            
                Based on the analysis, decide to:
                    Buy, Hold, or Sell the stock.
                    Set target prices or investment ranges if applicable.
            
            Step 10: Monitor and Review
            
                Regularly update your analysis as new financial statements are released.
                Adjust investment decisions based on performance against benchmarks and market conditions.
            
            Following these steps will allow for a comprehensive fundamental analysis of a company, providing insights 
            into financial health, operational efficiency, and overall market potential.

                Identify and note any missing or ambiguous data, including the potential impact on your confidence in the analysis.
                Ensure your final response follows a structured format typical for fundamental analysis.
